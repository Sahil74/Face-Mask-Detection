# Face Mask Detection Using MobileNetV2

## Project Overview

- This project involves the development of a deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image. 
Leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture, the model is fine-tuned for binary classification (with mask or without mask) using transfer 
learning. The project is essential in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where face masks became a critical measure for public health.

## Project Structure

- Data Augmentation: Utilized ImageDataGenerator to perform data augmentation, including random rotations, zooms, shifts, shearing, and horizontal flipping.
- Transfer Learning: Employed MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet as the base model, with additional layers on top for the specific task.
- Binary Classification: The model predicts whether a person in the image is wearing a mask or not.
- Real-Time Implementation: Developed a real-time face mask detection system using the trained model and OpenCV.
- Training:
The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, using a binary cross-entropy loss function.
Training was conducted over 20 epochs with a batch size of 32.
- Visualization: Training loss and accuracy plots are generated to visualize the performance of the model.

## Results

- The model achieves exceptional performance, with both training and validation loss nearing zero and accuracy approaching one. This indicates effective error minimization and high classification accuracy, demonstrating the modelâ€™s strong capability to generalize well on new data. The results underscore the model's robustness and suitability for accurate face mask detection in real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

- This project showcases the successful application of deep learning techniques for real-world problems, leveraging the power of 
pre-trained models and transfer learning. The face mask detection model, along with its real-time implementation, can be further 
improved and integrated into various systems for public health monitoring and safety compliance.
